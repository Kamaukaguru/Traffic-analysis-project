# Prject Overview / Business Understanding.
## 1.1 Introduction
The urban mobility and transportation sector are vital for the functioning of modern cities, enabling the movement of people and goods efficiently. Within this industry, traffic management and pedestrian safety are crucial components that directly impact the quality of life in urban areas. Effective traffic pattern analysis and prediction can help mitigate congestion, enhance safety, and improve overall urban mobility. Well managed traffic leads to minimized economic losses, improved quality of life especially on the side of pedestrians.

## 1.2 Problem Statement.
Urban areas continue to face significant challenges in managing their traffic congestion and ensuring pedestrian safety. The changing nature of these areas together with the increasing volume of both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, makes it hard for one to predict traffic patterns affectively.

## 1.3 Objectives
## 1.3.1 Main Objective
To create an accurate time series model(s) that can model, analyze and predict traffic congestion levels and pedestrian crossings at different times of the day.

## 1.3.2 Specific objectives
1. To evaluate how the number of floors impact the price of a house in King County.
2. To determine how the number of bedrooms impact the price of a house in King County.
3. To examine the impact the number of bathrooms has on the price of a house in King County.
4. To assess the impact of renovations on the price of a house in King County.
5. To determine how the square footage of living space of a house impacts house price in King County.
6. To evaluate which combinations of the available features in the dataset are the most impactful features for predicting sale price.
## Data Understanding 
The dataset is provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It has 4760 rows and 22 data features. 

## Data Preparation
We dropped the empty columns which were "body_roll', 'body_pitch', 'body_yaw',' head_roll', 'head_pitch', and 'head_yaw'. We also checked  for duplicate rows which we later dropped.
